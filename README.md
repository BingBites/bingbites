# BingBites

## Restaurants and Events listings made easy.

----------

BingBites is application for listing the restaurants or anyone who wants to list a place
in the locality intending to serve delicious food with events and their seasonal specialties.

````
We would be building the application with the following features

- Listing of the local restaurants

- Events scheduled daily at the local place

- Any specialties being served for the day.

Our target audience would be the people who often seek a delicious meal along with the pleasant ambiance and peculiar meal that matches your taste of food for your mood.

As of now this Project is under a coursework for CS545 Software Engineering, but we would want to expand on collaborations and would be accepting open source contributions soon.

Thank you for your interest to be a part of this open source initiative.

# Branching Strategy:

Master: Production branch
- Only feature to be released i.e final product goes to master

Develop: Feature after development 
- Checkout a new branch for every new feature to be developed
- Pull requests for any feature goes to develop branch

Feature: Branch specific to a feature
- Created from a develop 
- Whenever new feature is to be worked on, as like a homepage, create a new branch from develop 
- The feature branch would be merged to develop and develop would then be merged to master before deployments

Task/Story: Specific to an individual
- If multiple people work on a feature, use feature as a base branch for collaboration.
